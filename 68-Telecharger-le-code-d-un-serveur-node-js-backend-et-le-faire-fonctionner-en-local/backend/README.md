This is the back end server

You will need to have Node and `npm` installed locally on your machine.

From within the project folder, run `npm install`. 
You can then run the server with `nodemon server`. 
The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the
server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.
